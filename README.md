Squares!
========

This is a game I created initial just to learn Objective-C and iOS programming.  It's quite old, has been sitting dormant on my hard drive for quite a while.  I wouldn't use much if any of this as an example of good Objective-C...  I cleaned up a bit of the code (removed Flurry and OpenFeint) and made sure it compiled with iOS 5 before uploading.

The game "Squares!" did ok in the early days of the AppStore, I just ran out of time to keep it up to date and eventually pulled it when the Retina display came out.

Squares/ is the original iPhone game


SuperSquares/ was a follow on I started to support the iPad and has a number "what I learned" from the original - however, it was never completed.
