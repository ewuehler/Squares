#Squares!


__Squares!__  is a game I created initially just to learn Objective-C and iOS programming.  It's quite old, has been sitting dormant on my hard drive for quite a while.  I wouldn't use much (if any) of this as an example of good Objective-C...  I cleaned up a bit (read: _not much_) of the code and made sure it compiled with iOS 5 before uploading.  It did ok in the early days of the AppStore, but it was just a fun side project and I eventually ran out of time to keep it fresh and eventually pulled it from the AppStore when I just didn't think I could keep it up-to-date anymore.

__/Squares__ is the original iPhone game

__/SuperSquares__ was a follow on I started to support the iPad and has a number "what I learned" improvements from the original - however, it was never completed (and I still wouldn't use this as a good example of Objective-C). :)

##Reviews
Here are a few reviews of **Squares!** from "back in the day"...

“Squares! is a great buy for an iPhone game seeker with a strategic brain.”

- Review on [appcraver.com](http://www.appcraver.com/squares/) – “8/10”

“Quick to pick up and play, difficult to master. Lights-Out with a twist. An interesting puzzler that thankfully strays from the standard match 3 template.”

- Review on [theportablegamer.com](http://theportablegamer.com/2009/04/iphone-review-squares/) – “Buy It”

“[Squares!] is another of those games you can point to when you want to exemplify the concept of simple games often being some of the best games. This is one of those games you can pick up and play in a few spare moments and keep coming back to repeatedly … and often.”

- Review on [frapstr.com](http://www.frapstr.com/2009/04/28/squares/) – “Must Buy”
